# ShareNcare

Let's build the bridge of happiness together.

## 💡 Inspiration

There is a common problem that we hostellers or someone who does not have a permanent resident faces. it is none other than "what should we do with all these books, utensils, Furniture, etc etc?" "where should I sell all of these things, who will buy them?" "Where can I donate stuff that I no longer use?". there is another burdensome thing that students face daily since most of the students are broke they cannot afford to buy something they want. To combat this issue we developed **ShareNcare** where users can search by filter near their lodging and buy stuff they can use to set up their tiny little not-so-permanent home. On ShareNcare users can exchange things as well according to their needs. they don't have to pay a penny to buy things they need with this exchange system.
When we discuss students, there is a very concerning issue that we should solve together.**According in most of the studies, students have the largest consumption of fast fashion**. At some point in time we students do feel guilty about our fast fashion choices, many times since we are broke we opt for fast fashion. To solve this issue as well we developed a separate portal on **ShareNcare** where user can donate their fast fashion clothes to anyone be it a student or an employee. Even though these are small steps toward sustainability but every step matter.

## 💻 What it does

- Users can donate their **fast fashion clothes** effectively.
- Students can exchange their books, notes, and electronics by uploading their requirements.
- Students can sell their things with a fellow nearby lodger.
